# iOS-CodeChallenge
Build a simple Weather App

### Challenge Description
In this challenge you will be making a simple weather app that will fetch the weekly weather data from forecast.io and display only the high temperatures for each day. It doesn't have to look super fancy. Just a single label for each row with the temperature will do. You can pick a random location or use CoreLocation for extra points. We will be looking at how you use version control so please think about a branching model before you start. In addition to that, we will be looking at the overall architecture of your code to see if there is a clear separation of concerns (MVC), error handling logic, and your use of delegation/blocks. When you are done add me as a contributor to your repository.
